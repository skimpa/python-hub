some useful python code from skimpa

dynip.py
A program that periodically checks my routers ip address and then sends an email to chosen accounts with the data.
I needed this as I was recently locked out of my machines whilst working away. For whatever reason, duckdns did not get a copy of my changed IP address,so i could not ssh onto my network.... I want to make sure that this situation NEVER happens again.
(Strong possibility the issue was due to cronie being stopped - rather than a duckdns.org issue )
